## Abstract [Paper](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Marwan-Torki/publication/348884897_AQAD_17000_Arabic_Questions_for_Machine_Comprehension_of_Text/links/60145f4d92851c2d4d02ffe3/AQAD-17-000-Arabic-Questions-for-Machine-Comprehension-of-Text.pdf)
Current Arabic Machine Reading for Question Answering datasets suffer from important shortcomings.
The available datasets are either small-sized high-quality collections or large-sized low-quality datasets. 
To address the aforemen- tioned problems we present our Arabic Question-Answer dataset (AQAD). 
AQAD is a new Arabic reading comprehension large- sized high-quality dataset consisting of 17,000+ questions and answers. 
To collect the AQAD dataset, we present a fully automated data collector. 
Our collector works on a set of Arabic Wikipedia articles for the extractive question answering task. 
The chosen articles match the articles used in the well-known Stanford Question Answering Dataset (SQuAD). 
We provide evaluation results on the AQAD dataset using two state-of-the-art models for machine-reading question answering problems. 
Namely, BERT and BIDAF models which result in 0.37 and 0.32 F-1 measure on AQAD dataset.
